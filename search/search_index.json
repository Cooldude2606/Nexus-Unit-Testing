Examples can be found in: 1. /test/NexusUnitTesting_Assertions.lua 2. /test/NexusUnitTesting_EdgeCases.lua 3. /test/NexusUnitTesting_Static.lua Properties NexusUnitTesting.Util A table of the available utilities included as part of Nexus Unit Testing. Right now this includes: 1. NexusUnitTesting.Util.DependencyInjector Functions NexusUnitTesting.new() Creates an instance of a NexusUnitTesting as an individual unit test. A Name can also be assigned to the object. Note This is meant for internal use. It is recommended to use NexusUnitTesting::RegisterUnitTest instead. Not using that function may result in compatibility problems when running unit tests. Note Instantiating a unit test is not required to run assertions. Assertions are run statically, but will not have an associated name and will not implicitly call pass at the end of a unit test. NexusUnitTesting:RegisterUnitTest(String Name,Function UnitTestFunction) Creates an instance of a unit test, sets the name of the unit test, and runs the unit test function in a co-routine. The given function has the unit test as a parameter for running assertions. NexusUnitTesting:Pass() Ends the unit tests and considers the test a success. Note This is implictly called with a unit test ran with NexusUnitTesting::RegisterUnitTest . Warning This method will cause the current thread to yield. If unit tests are not run as separate processes, this will stop all unit tests (and anything else) being run. NexusUnitTesting::RegisterUnitTest is recommended to avoid this behavior. NexusUnitTesting:Fail() Ends the unit tests and considers the test a failure. Warning This method will cause the current thread to yield. If unit tests are not run as separate processes, this will stop all unit tests (and anything else) being run. NexusUnitTesting::RegisterUnitTest is recommended to avoid this behavior. NexusUnitTesting:Assert(Function Assertion,String FailureMessage) Runs the given function. If the function returns true, the assertion is considered true. If anything else is returned, the assertion is considered false and will fail the unit test. If the assertion fails, the message will be an error message. Tip All assertions will call this function to with a function. This means only this can be overridden rather than all of the assertions NexusUnitTesting:AssertEquals(Object Expected,Object Actual,String FailureMessage) Asserts that two objects are equivalent. This is intended for tables that may have the same entries but different memory references. Bug There is no check for cyclic tables. A recursive depth will be reached instead of returning the correct value. NexusUnitTesting:AssertNotEquals(Object NotExpected,Object Actual,String FailureMessage) Asserts that two objects are not equivalent. This is intended for tables that may have the same entries but different memory references. Bug There is no check for cyclic tables. A recursive depth will be reached instead of returning the correct value. NexusUnitTesting:AssertSame(Object Expected,Object Actual,String FailureMessage) Asserts that performing == on the two objects is true. For tables, this means the memory reference has to be the same. NexusUnitTesting:AssertNotSame(Object NotExpected,Object Actual,String FailureMessage) Asserts that performing == on the two objects is false. For tables, this means the memory reference has to be the same. NexusUnitTesting:AssertClose(Object Expected,Object Actual,Float Epsilon,String FailureMessage) Asserts that two objects are within a given Epsilon of each other. This is recommended for floats or data types that include floats. NexusUnitTesting:AssertNotClose(Object NotExpected,Object Actual,Float Epsilon,String FailureMessage) Asserts that two objects are not within a given Epsilon of each other. This is recommended for floats or data types that include floats. NexusUnitTesting:AssertTrue(Boolean Actual,String FailureMessage) Asserts that a given bool is true . NexusUnitTesting:AssertFalse(Boolean Actual,String FailureMessage) Asserts that a given bool is false . NexusUnitTesting:AssertNil(Object Actual,String FailureMessage) Asserts that a given object is nil . NexusUnitTesting:AssertNotNil(Object Actual,String FailureMessage) Asserts that a given object is not nil . NexusUnitTesting:AssertErrors(Function FunctionWithError,String FailureMessage) Asserts that a given function will produce an error.","title":"Nexus Unit Testing Module"},{"location":"getting-started/nexus-unit-testing-module/#nexus-unit-testing-module","text":"The following is the documentation for the main module.

The unit tests use Nexus Unit Testing, but it can be used with any unit testing framework. Examples of what it can be used for, included in the tests in /test/NexusUnitTesting/Util/DependencyInjector_Examples.lua include: 1. Overriding random number generators to be predictable. 2. Creating \"seams\" for requiring ModuleScripts. 3. Simulating DataStoreService and HttpService failures. 4. Creating fake Workspaces and Players. DependencyInjector Functions DependencyInjector.Inject(Table TableToInject,Injector InjectorObject) Injects the global variables of a given table with an injector object. DependencyInjector.InjectEnvironmentVariables(Object ObjectToInject,Injector InjectorObject) Injects the global variables of a given function or table with an injector object. DependencyInjector.Require(ModuleScript Script,Injector InjectorObject) Requires a clone of a ModuleScript with injected global variables. This is done by modifying the source to encapsulate the module in a function and overriding the function's global variables. The ModuleScript is cloned so the injection doesn't persist and gets around the caching problem. Unless overridden, require() is overridden with DependencyInjector::Require and script is replaced with the original script's reference. Note ModuleScript dependency injection requires cloning and modification of the source. It has to be run in a plugin or command line context. DependencyInjector.CreateOverrider() Creates and returns an overrider class. This is used for the various injection methods. Overrider Functions Overrider.new() Creates an instance of an Overrider class. This is called with DependencyInjector.CreateOverrider() . Overrider:Clone() Clones the overrider object. It does not clone the individual overriders, but adding new overrides will not affect the existing object. Overrider:GetIndexOverride(Object Index) Returns the IndexOverrider for a given index. Nil gets returned if there is no override. Overrider:GetIndexOverride(Object Index) Returns the IndexOverrider for a given index. Nil gets returned if there is no override. Overrider:GetCallOverride(Object Index,Table Parameters) Returns the CallOverrider for a given index. Nil gets returned if there is no Overrider or the Overriders can't return for the given parameters. Overrider:WhenIndexed(Object Index) Creates and returns an IndexOverrider object for a given index. Overrider:WhenCalled(Index,...) Creates and returns a CallOverrider object for a given index. Any additional parameters are treated as parameters that must match to be considered an override. An example is overriding math.random if the bounds are 2 and 5. IndexOverrider Functions IndexOverrider.new() Creates an IndexOverrider object. IndexOverrider:HasOverride() Returns if there an override set for the IndexOverrider. IndexOverrider:GetOverride() Returns the current override. IndexOverrider:ThenReturn(Object Override) Sets the override to return a fixed object when IndexOverrider::GetOverride is called. IndexOverrider:ThenCall(Function ReturnFunction) Sets the override to a function. When IndexOverrider::GetOverride is called, the given function will be run and the override will be what the function returns. CallOverride Functions CallOverrider.new(Table RequiredParameters) Creates a CallOverrider object. Takes in a set of required parameters for the override to be called. CallOverrider:CanBeCalled(Table GivenParameters) Returns if the override is valid for the given set of overrides. It is assumed an extra parameters beyond the initial RequiredParameters will be considered valid. CallOverrider:GetReturn(...) Returns the override with the given set of parameters. CallOverrider:ThenReturn(Object Override) Sets the CallOverrider to return a specific Object when called. CallOverrider:ThenCall(Function Callback) Sets the CallOverrider to call a given callback and return what the Callback returns. The Callback's parameters will include all of the parameters that the function was called with.

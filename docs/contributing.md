# Contributing
Bugs and requests can be made through issues. Pull requests are
open, but will only be accepted if they have the following:
<br>1. A reason to be pulled.
<br>2. Follow the existing coding standards (tabs, PascalCase, etc).
<br>3. Have the appropriate unit tests as examples. This is mainly for new utilities.
<br>4. Comments are included.

## Pulling Into Studio
The format of this repository is based on [rojo by LPGhatguy](https://github.com/LPGhatguy/rojo).
Any other tools that follow the same file structure will work.

## Exporting From Studio
No public tool is currently provided for exporting Rojo
projects from Roblox Studio. "Nexus Project Syncer" currently
exists as an internal tool but would require signifcant work
to be published. The final version that will be relased (hopefully
by the end of July) would be known as "Nexus Git" or "Nexus RoGit"
to be able to pull and push projects, as well as handle common
Git actions.

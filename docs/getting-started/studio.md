# Studio
The intended use for Nexus Unit Testing is with the associated 
plugin, but it can be used stand-alone.

## Plugin
The plugin has not been released. The documentation will come later.

## Module
The ModuleScript version can be used if the plugin is not preferred.
To set it up, the ModuleScript can be obtained from the 
[releases page](https://github.com/TheNexusAvenger/Nexus-Unit-Testing/releases)
as a Roblox model file. The recommended location is the
[`TestService`](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/TestService), 
but any other location will work. Requiring the ModuleScript works like 
any other with the [`require(ModuleScript module)`](https://developer.roblox.com/articles/Built-in-Functions-and-Variables/Roblox)
function.
